# Repo Readme

Replication files for *The Pervasive Presence of Chinese GovernmentContent on Douyin Trending Videos* (R&R, *Computational Communication Research*)

We went through three steps to finish the final results. 

Step 1: We collected metadata and video data of the Douyin Trending videos, and all data used for this study are stored in *CCR_final_nc.csv*

Step 2: For video data, we extract visual features through the code *feature_final.py*. We also provided five videos to test on the code.

Step 3: Using all metadata and results from visual analysis, we created all figures and tables through *CCR_RR_nc.R*.

Variable descriptions can be seen in *variables_readme.txt*
